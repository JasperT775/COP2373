2)This program creates a database to store the population data of 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023 and simulates population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% growth rate per year. It then allows the user to visualize the population growth of a chosen city using the turtle graphics module.
3)conn: SQLite connection object.
cursor: SQLite cursor object.
cities: List of tuples containing initial population data for 10 cities.
initial_data: Data fetched from the database containing initial population values for the year 2023.
years: List of years for the chosen city.
populations: List of population values for the chosen city.
4)create_database(): Creates a SQLite database and table for population data.
insert_initial_data(): Inserts initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023.
simulate_population_growth(): Simulates population growth at a 2% annual rate for the next 20 years and inserts the data into the database.
visualize_population_growth(): Visualizes the population growth of a chosen city using the turtle graphics module.
main(): Executes the workflow by calling the other functions in sequence.
5)Create Database and Table

Connect to SQLite database.
Create population table if it does not exist.
Insert Initial Data

Define initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023.
Insert this data into the population table.
Simulate Population Growth

Fetch initial population data for the year 2023.
For each city, simulate population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% annual growth rate.
Insert the simulated data into the population table.
Visualize Population Growth

List the 10 cities and prompt the user to choose one.
Fetch population data for the chosen city from the database.
Use the turtle graphics module to plot the population growth over the years.
Main Function
