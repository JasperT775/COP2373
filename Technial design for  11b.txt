2)This program calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when given the nearest angle (in degrees) and the length of the adjacent side. It uses basic trigonometry, specifically the cosine function, to determine the hypotenuse length.
3)
angle_degrees: This variable holds the value of the nearest angle in degrees provided by the user.
adjacent_length: This variable holds the value of the length of the adjacent side provided by the user.
angle_radians: This variable holds the value of the angle converted from degrees to radians.
hypotenuse_length: This variable holds the calculated length of the hypotenuse.
4)Input: angle_degrees (nearest angle in degrees) and adjacent_length (length of the adjacent side).
Process:
Convert the angle from degrees to radians using the math.radians function.
Calculate the hypotenuse length using the cosine function: 
hypotenuse_length
=
adjacent_length
cos
⁡(angle_radians)
hypotenuse_length= 
cos(angle_radians)
adjacent_length
​
 .
Output: Return the calculated hypotenuse length.
5)Import the math module.
Define the function calculate_hypotenuse with parameters angle_degrees and adjacent_length.
Inside the function:
Convert angle_degrees to radians and store in angle_radians.
Calculate hypotenuse_length using the formula: 
hypotenuse_length
=
adjacent_length
cos
⁡
(
angle_radians
)
hypotenuse_length= 
cos(angle_radians)
adjacent_length
​
 .
Return hypotenuse_length.
Set example values for angle and adjacent.
Call calculate_hypotenuse with the example values.
Print the length of the hypotenuse, formatted to two decimal places.
