2)This Python program defines a Money class that encapsulates basic operations on monetary values (amount), including addition, subtraction, and multiplication by scalars. It uses operator overloading to support these operations (+, -, *). Additionally, there is a test function that validates these operations by creating instances of Money objects and performing arithmetic operations on them, printing the results.
3)In the Money class:

amount: Instance variable initialized with a default value of 0.0.
In the test_money_operations function:

money1: An instance of Money initialized with 100.0.
money2: An instance of Money initialized with 50.0.
scalar: A floating-point scalar value (1.5) used for multiplication.
4)Money class:

__init__(self, amount=0.0): Initializes a Money object with an optional initial amount.
__add__(self, other): Overloads the + operator to perform addition between two Money objects.
__sub__(self, other): Overloads the - operator to perform subtraction between two Money objects.
__mul__(self, other): Overloads the * operator to multiply a Money object by a scalar (int or float).
__str__(self): Provides a string representation of the Money object formatted to two decimal places.
test_money_operations function:

test_money_operations(): Creates instances (money1, money2) of Money.
Tests addition (money1 + money2), subtraction (money1 - money2), and multiplication (money1 * scalar) operations.
Prints results of each operation to verify correctness.
5)Define the Money class:

Initialize with an optional amount.
Implement operator overloading (+, -, *) to support addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations.
Provide a string representation method (__str__) for displaying Money objects.
Define the test_money_operations function:

Create instances (money1, money2) of Money.
Test addition (money1 + money2), subtraction (money1 - money2), and multiplication (money1 * scalar) operations.
Print results of each operation to verify correctness.
Execute the test function:

Check if the script is being run directly (if __name__ == "__main__").
Call test_money_operations() to run tests and display results.
